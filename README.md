# TFG_RaquelGimenezPascual

On this Github you can find three implementations of TCAV on discrete data. The datasets employed incude KDD Cup'99, NSL-KDD, and UNSW_NB15. An analysis on these datasets will allow feature selection to determine its importance to the IDS model.

Three jupyter notebooks, one for each dataset, demonstrate the following functionality:

- Analysis of the dataset and feature selection.
- Creation of concepts and targets datasets.
- Creation and training of an MLP model.
- Running TCAV on the model and the concepts and targets previously selected.

# Installation

Tensorflow must be installed to execute the TCAV algorithm. Execute the following command to install the TCAV package. 

```
!pip install tcav
```

# Requirements
- Tensorflow
