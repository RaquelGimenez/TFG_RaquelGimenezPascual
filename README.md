# TFG_RaquelGimenezPascual

On this Github you can find three implementations of TCAV on discrete data. The datasets employed incude KDD Cup'99, NSL-KDD, and UNSW_NB15. An analysis on these datasets will allow feature selection to determine its importance to the IDS model.

Three jupyter notebooks, one for each dataset, demonstrate the implemented functionality:

- Analysis of the dataset and feature selection.
- Creation of concepts and targets datasets.
- Creation and training of an MLP model.
- Running TCAV on the model and the concepts and targets previously selected.

# Installation

Tensorflow must be installed, as well as the TCAV package. If the code is executed in GoogleColab, no further installation is required.

# Requirements
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- Pillow
